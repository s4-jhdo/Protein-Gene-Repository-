# Protein-Gene-Repository-
Hi! This guide outlines a systematic procedure for employing the tools, commands, and programs I utilized to collect the required data for the Bio 312 research paper focusing on the evolutionary analysis of a gene assigned within the context of deuterostomes.

# Creating a Directory
Firstly, create a directory where we can store all computations related to AKAP17A (or the specific protein you are working with) by executing the following command: 
'''bash
mkdir /home/ec2-user/AKAPS
'''
This command will create a directory within the ec2-user folder in Visual Studio code (VScode). You also have the flexibility to designate a different or specific location for placing this file.
